## BUG
- super weird bug: when publishing to npm, the project needs to be build using the 'classic' method: building it into a js / ts library.
  - BUT the `npx tsc --build` or `npm run build -> tsc--build` commands only SOMETIMES create a new build...
  - WORKAROUND is deleting the dist folder manually, change the tsconfig a bit, and try again...
  - this is related, but not the same thing: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8186
